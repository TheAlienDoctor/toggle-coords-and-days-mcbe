# Pack name
## Information
This resource pack allows you to toggle whether co-ordinates are shown on screen or not, via the use of the f8 key on pc. This is espically useful if you are streaming or recording, and don't want people to see your location.
## Download
You can download this pack from my website: https://TheAlienDoctor.com <br>
You can also view the changelog, showcase video and any other information there.
## How does it work?
Essentially this pack removes the paper doll, and then uses the setting originally for the paper doll for hding/showing the co-ords. This is because, for whatever reason, hard coded into the game you can use the f8 key to show/hide the paper doll. This pack makes the player position element use that setting instead of the paper doll one. Unfortunatly this does mean that the paper doll is permanently hidden, however I am working on alternatives that may allow the paper doll to also be visible if you want that.
